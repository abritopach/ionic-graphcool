# Ionic-Graphcool

Sample project that shows a fullstack application where we will be building a shopping list in Ionic that uses GraphCool as its database and backend.

    * Frontend: Ionic.
    * Backend: GraphCool

This project is an example created in the [Ashteya Biharisingh Blog](https://gonehybrid.com/how-to-build-an-ionic-app-with-a-graphcool-backend-part-1/)that have been modified by me. This project has been developed to practice my skills with the tech stack shown above. This project shows you how to:

    * Querying data.
    * Mutations.
    * Real-time subscriptions.
